# 👋 Hi there

<img src="/images/banner.png" alt="Banner" width="1024">

I'm a reverse engineer and low-level software developer with a focus on Windows internals, malware analysis, and tooling.  
I like taking things apart — binaries, protocols, algorithms — and building tools that make that process faster and smarter.

Whether it's obfuscated malware, a network protocol nobody documented, or some shady packed executable — I dive deep.

## 🔍 What I do

- 🧠 **Reverse engineering** — x86/x64, custom loaders, obfuscated binaries  
- 🐛 **Malware analysis** — API hashing, anti-debug tricks, unpacking, decryptors  
- 🔓 **Exploit & tooling dev** — shellcode, memory injection, WinAPI hash resolvers  
- 🎲 **PRNG & algorithm reversing** — LCG, MT, XOR-mutation-based, encryption logic  
- 🎮 **Game hacking** — client-side logic, anti-cheat bypass, automation  
- 🤖 **Android automation** — ADB + CV + shell scripting, anti-fraud evasion  
- 🌐 **Protocol reverse engineering** — WebSocket, RPC, custom binary formats  
- ⚙️ **Static & dynamic analysis automation** — for scale and repeatability

## 🧪 Languages I use

- **Core stack:** `C++`, `C`, `Python`  
- **Also touched:** `JS`, `Lua`, `Pawn`, `C#`, `Java`, `PHP`

## 📂 Reverse writeups & experiments

Curious about some of the stuff I've reversed?  
Check out my public notes and writeups here:

> ⚠️ Most of my RE-related work is private (malware tooling, automation, exploit dev, etc).  
> What's public here is a small part of what I've done.

## 💬 Why reverse engineering?

It's the closest thing to solving a puzzle where the pieces fight back.  
It forces you to understand *exactly* how something works — not how it looks on the surface.  
That's what I enjoy. That's what I do.
